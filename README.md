# ⏳💰 The ChronoBank – A Smart and Secure Time-Based Banking System

Welcome to **The ChronoBank**, a futuristic, decentralized digital banking system where **⏱ time is money** — literally! This Java-based project leverages **Object-Oriented Programming** and **Design Patterns** to build a secure, fair, and scalable time-based economy in the city of **NeoHorizon**.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

In NeoHorizon, time has replaced traditional currency. Citizens **earn, spend, transfer, invest, and borrow time**. But after a recent system upgrade, things went wrong:

- ❌ Time accounts displayed **negative balances**  
- 🔐 Users were **locked out** of their time wallets  
- 🤑 Wealthy citizens **exploited loopholes**  
- 💣 The loan system **malfunctioned** with **infinite or erased time**

The **ChronoBank Council** has tasked our OOP engineering team to **redesign the system** to ensure **security, fairness, and stability** using Java and advanced software design principles.

## 🛠️ Project Requirements

We designed a time-based banking platform with the following core goals:

### 🎯 OOP Concepts
- **Encapsulation**: Secure customer data and transactions  
- **Inheritance**: Support for account types like `BasicTimeAccount`, `InvestorAccount`, `LoanAccount`  
- **Polymorphism**: Flexibility in transaction operations – `Transfer`, `Loan`, `Investment`  
- **Abstraction**: Simplified APIs for operations  

---

## 🏗️ Design Patterns Implemented

### 🔧 Creational Patterns
- **Factory Pattern**: Create different types of accounts dynamically  
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensure a central, secure ledger of time transactions  
- **Builder Pattern**: Allow custom account configurations (e.g., interest rates)

### 🧱 Structural Patterns
- **Facade Pattern**: Unified interface for complex banking operations  
- **Adapter Pattern**: Integrate old currency systems with the new time system  
- **Decorator Pattern**: Add features like **time tax**, **rewards**, or **bonuses**

### 🔁 Behavioral Patterns
- **Observer Pattern**: Alert users on low balance, fraud, and deadlines  
- **Strategy Pattern**: Multiple loan repayment models  
- **Command Pattern**: **Undo/redo** capabilities for transactions  
- **State Pattern**: Account status tracking (Active, Overdrawn, Frozen)

---

## 🔒 Security & Extra Features

- 🕵️ **Fraud Detection**: Detect "time laundering" or rapid suspicious transfers  
- 📈 **Smart Loans & Investments**: Auto-adjust interest with market conditions  
- 🔐 **Access Control**: Block risky transactions based on user risk scores

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Java** (Core)
- **PostgreSQL** 🐘 (Database)
- **Object-Oriented Programming**
- **Design Patterns** (Creational, Structural, Behavioral)
